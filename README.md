## File Formats

Hereâ€™s a list of the available file formats and how to use them:

### ASE
- **Description:** The `.ase` file format is used for Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE) files, which are compatible with various design tools, including Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This format preserves the colour palette, making it easy to transfer colour schemes across different applications.
- **Usage:** Import the `.ase` file into Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, or other compatible design tools to use the Catppuccin colour palette in your projects.

### Aseprite
- **Description:** The `.aseprite` format is used for [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), a pixel art tool. This format preserves the palette colours, allowing you to use the Catppuccin theme directly in your pixel art projects.
- **Usage:** Load the `.aseprite` file directly into Aseprite to use the palette for your artwork.

### GPL
- **Description:** A `.gpl` file format compatible with [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and other graphics tools that support GIMP palette files.
- **Usage:** Simply import the GPL file into GIMP or other supported applications to use the palette in your designs.

### HEX
- **Description:** The `.hex` file format is a simple text-based format that contains a list of colour values in hexadecimal (HEX) notation. Each color is represented by a six-character code, typically prefixed with a hash (#), corresponding to the RGB values of the color. This format is often used to store colour palettes.
- **Usage:** Open the `.hex` file in any text editor or design tool that supports HEX colour values. You can then copy the color codes and use them in web design, graphic software, or any application that accepts HEX colour codes.

### PAL
- **Description:** The `.pal` file format is used to store indexed colour palettes, commonly used in graphics programs like Pro Motion NG, GraphicsGale, and other pixel art or retro graphics tools. This format stores colours in a specific order and is optimized for use in pixel art and game development.
- **Usage:** Import the `.pal` file into any application that supports the PAL format to easily access the Catppuccin colour palette for your projects.


### PNG
- **Description:** A `.png` image showing the Catppuccin colour palette as a visual reference. It includes all the colours arranged in an easy-to-view format.
- **Usage:** Use the `.png` file as a reference for the Catppuccin colours when creating artwork or web designs.

### SVG
- **Description:** The `.svg` file format is a scalable vector graphic format that uses XML to describe two-dimensional vector graphics. It is widely supported across web browsers and graphic design software, making it an ideal choice for high-quality, scalable designs.
- **Usage:** Use the `.svg` file as a scalable vector graphic in web design, digital illustrations, or any application that supports vector graphics. You can easily scale the image without loss of quality, making it perfect for responsive designs.
